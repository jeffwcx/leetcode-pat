Calculate $a + b$ and output the sum in standard format -- that is, the digits must be separated into groups of three by commas (unless there are less than four digits).

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a pair of integers $a$ and $b$ where $-10^6 \le a, b \le 10^6$. The numbers are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, you should output the sum of $a$ and $b$ in one line. The sum must be written in the standard format.

### Sample Input:
```in
-1000000 9
```

### Sample Output:
```out
-999,991
```
